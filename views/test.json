As an organization engaged in policy advocacy, it\u2019s natural for the Boulder Chamber to consider how to interpret voter intent from this year\u2019s election and how to respond, while still making sure we\u2019re meeting the needs of businesses and supporting economic vitality. Well, here it goes:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing is vital:<\/strong> There were many themes that permeated the campaign dialogue in 2021, but one was preeminent across political lines: the need for housing that is accessible to the wide diversity of our workforce and families. This is an exciting turn, indicating movement from debating about if we need more housing in our community, to how to accommodate it.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_979156\"  class=\"wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third\"><img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"499px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 210w\" width=\"2767\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/John-Tayer-Edit-3print.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 210w\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">John TayerThe Boulder Chamber View<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Along those lines, this year\u2019s Council candidates all seemed to recognize the environmental, social equity, and economic values that expanded housing opportunities offer our community. Where they differed most clearly was on their relative tolerance for infill development that more directly impacts established neighborhoods. I also put the split in support for the Bedrooms Are For People initiative in that same category.<\/p>\n<p>While not a carte blanche to unrestricted zoning, the final election results seem to indicate support for pulling a little harder on the infill lever. I think all would agree there is great encouragement for housing development in previously single-use commercial zones. In addition, it appears there is license to experiment with opportunities for development and regulatory adjustments that provide a wider spectrum of housing choices in our neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>People are vital: As I mentioned in my previous post-election column, the most significant background issue in this election was the treatment of homeless encampments. The divide in that area isn\u2019t likely as deep as some would characterize, with generally uniform support for enforcement of community safety and public health standards, coupled with compassionate care for those experiencing homelessness. It is the character of that compassion where most of our disputes reside.<\/p>\n<p>I personally think the roots of our collective policy sentiments with respect to homelessness run deeper to a general community ethos of concern for those who haven\u2019t benefited equitably from the prosperity so many here enjoy. Boulder makes great investment in support of those who struggle to find housing and to address basic needs. As the election results appear to bear out, there\u2019s an interest in doing even more in that area. The Boulder Chamber will work to be a partner in that effort, committing our resources to a \u201cstrong and inclusive economic recovery\u201d from the pandemic. Some have suffered more severe impacts from the pandemic, often due to systemic challenges our community can no longer ignore.<\/p>\n<p>Business is vital: It is no secret that certain elements of Boulder\u2019s economy are surging. At the same time, many of our businesses still suffer under the strains of pandemic-induced or -accelerated change that undermines operation models and imposes significant additional costs. This is evident in everything from the obvious \u201cFor Lease\u201d signs that hang in the window of a favorite restaurant and in the less visible loss of an entrepreneurial technology business.<\/p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve said in other venues, when our businesses suffer, our community character suffers. An important draw for Boulder residents and visitors is its innovative cuisine, retail and cultural venues. These assets also have been a source of sales tax revenue that fuels municipal coffers that fund the programs, services and facilities we all enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>A quick scan of the candidate scorecard the Boulder Chamber produced for this election reveals unanimous support for the proposition that our community should \u201caccept increased job growth as a potential consequence of sustaining a strong economy.\u201d This is an encouraging sign of community and political will for the necessary measures to revive our economy, for all. Investment in business support services and a focus on comprehensive strategic economic planning are critical steps we must take in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>So that is what the Boulder Chamber would have us do in the wake of the 2021 election. Now let\u2019s get to it!<\/p>\n",

            "print_content": "<p>I wrote last week for a partner news organization about what I thought happened in this last election. As an organization engaged in policy advocacy, it\u2019s natural for the Boulder Chamber to consider how to interpret voter intent from this year\u2019s election and how to respond, while still making sure we\u2019re meeting the needs of businesses and supporting economic vitality. Well, here it goes:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing is vital:<\/strong> There were many themes that permeated the campaign dialogue in 2021, but one was preeminent across political lines: the need for housing that is accessible to the wide diversity of our workforce and families. This is an exciting turn, indicating movement from debating about if we need more housing in our community, to how to accommodate it.<\/p>\n<p>Along those lines, this year\u2019s Council candidates all seemed to recognize the environmental, social equity, and economic values that expanded housing opportunities offer our community. Where they differed most clearly was on their relative tolerance for infill development that more directly impacts established neighborhoods. I also put the split in support for the Bedrooms Are For People initiative in that same category.<\/p>\n<p>While not a carte blanche to unrestricted zoning, the final election results seem to indicate support for pulling a little harder on the infill lever. I think all would agree there is great encouragement for housing development in previously single-use commercial zones. In addition, it appears there is license to experiment with opportunities for development and regulatory adjustments that provide a wider spectrum of housing choices in our neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>People are vital: As I mentioned in my previous post-election column, the most significant background issue in this election was the treatment of homeless encampments. The divide in that area isn\u2019t likely as deep as some would characterize, with generally uniform support for enforcement of community safety and public health standards, coupled with compassionate care for those experiencing homelessness. It is the character of that compassion where most of our disputes reside.<\/p>\n<p>I personally think the roots of our collective policy sentiments with respect to homelessness run deeper to a general community ethos of concern for those who haven\u2019t benefited equitably from the prosperity so many here enjoy. Boulder makes great investment in support of those who struggle to find housing and to address basic needs. As the election results appear to bear out, there\u2019s an interest in doing even more in that area. The Boulder Chamber will work to be a partner in that effort, committing our resources to a \u201cstrong and inclusive economic recovery\u201d from the pandemic. Some have suffered more severe impacts from the pandemic, often due to systemic challenges our community can no longer ignore.<\/p>\n<p>Business is vital: It is no secret that certain elements of Boulder\u2019s economy are surging. At the same time, many of our businesses still suffer under the strains of pandemic-induced or -accelerated change that undermines operation models and imposes significant additional costs. This is evident in everything from the obvious \u201cFor Lease\u201d signs that hang in the window of a favorite restaurant and in the less visible loss of an entrepreneurial technology business.<\/p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve said in other venues, when our businesses suffer, our community character suffers. An important draw for Boulder residents and visitors is its innovative cuisine, retail and cultural venues. These assets also have been a source of sales tax revenue that fuels municipal coffers that fund the programs, services and facilities we all enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>A quick scan of the candidate scorecard the Boulder Chamber produced for this election reveals unanimous support for the proposition that our community should \u201caccept increased job growth as a potential consequence of sustaining a strong economy.\u201d This is an encouraging sign of community and political will for the necessary measures to revive our economy, for all. Investment in business support services and a focus on comprehensive strategic economic planning are critical steps we must take in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>So that is what the Boulder Chamber would have us do in the wake of the 2021 election. Now let\u2019s get to it!<\/p>\n",

(Courtesy image)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The book still gives me pleasure to have around and reread parts of on occasion. Last week, with the holidays and the search for gifts looming, I stopped by the local running stores to gather some recommendations to pass along on what you can give to surprise the runner in your life.<\/p>\n<p>I started my search over at In Motion Running and was pleased to see a couple of books prominently displayed right inside the front entrance: Bobby Reyes\u2019 novel \u201cBolder Dreams\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing well with it,\u201d said staffer Greg Weich) and \u201cWin at All Costs,\u201d by Erie\u2019s Matt Hart.<\/p>\n<p>Also popular this season at In Motion is gear from local company 303 (stocking stuffers); gift cards (growing in popularity); and shoes and socks. Weich, nearing his 25th year in running retail, said a recent trend has been folks buying a pair of shoes to gift wrap, with the recipient then encouraged to come back later for a free gait analysis to ensure it is the proper fit.<\/p>\n<p>A short jog away, at the Boulder Running Company, Hank Church did not hesitate when he answered, \u201cSocks; seasonal socks, sale shoes, nutrition goodies, and any kind of lighter reflective gear.\u201d Massage items sell well at the BRC, including the mainstay Roll Recovery out of Gunbarrel (which all the stores carry) as well as Theragun massage products.<\/p>\n<p>Over at the south end of town, books are also selling well at Runners Roost, specifically cookbooks for runners. Prominently displayed near the front entrance are Emma Coburn\u2019s \u201cThe Runner\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d as well as \u201cRun Fast, Eat Slow\u201d and \u201cRise and Run\u201d by Elyse Kopecky and Shalane Flanagan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey make great gifts,\u201d said the Roost\u2019s Sandy Cirillo because the cookbooks combine stories from Olympians Coburn, a CU grad and local resident, and Flanagan, along with their experiences with food and recipes. \u201cThe cookbooks are well done with good photos and graphics, and they are relatable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cirillo also recommended a new brand of clothing called Vuori, that is \u201csuper, super soft, some technical (wear), some everyday; it\u2019s breathable and fits well.\u201d And, echoing In Motion\u2019s Weich, she agreed that a gift card \u201cis always nice,\u201d showing that you are taking an interest in going to a store that represents the passion of your runner friend or family member.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1152823\"  class=\"wp-caption alignleft size-article_inline_third\"><img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"458px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 210w\" width=\"3424\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/dcc-z-RollRecovery.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 210w\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boulder World Championship 3000 meter steeplechase gold medalist Emma Coburn holds the eponymous R8 Roll Recovery deep tissue massage roller, one of the many possible gifts for the runner in your life. (ROLL Recovery\/Courtesy photo)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While it might be easier to shop online, there are several benefits to in-person, local shopping. First, there is the social aspect. Visiting with the sales clerks, asking them what\u2019s in, what\u2019s out this season can be fun. In addition, you get the benefit of their expertise. Some gifts, of course, have to be bought online, such as this promise from Boulder Olympian Adam Goucher on his website: \u201cVisiting this site may cause increased happiness!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well now, giving the gift of happiness is a biggie, one that shows you don\u2019t need fancy gear to be a runner. What matters is consistency in getting out the door, and spurring motivation is what Goucher is doing with his programs Run the Year and Fit Life Project. They comprise a worldwide community of runners and walkers that keeps one accountable and allows she\/he\/they to keep track of their miles on the way to achieving a big goal.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to give a gift of encouragement \u2014 signing a runner up for a local training club such as Revolution Running, Boulder Striders, Athletic Boulder; or for kids, Mountain Warriors and Mountain Lions. Or an entry to the 2022 Bolder Boulder 10K, which is expected to be back at full capacity next Memorial Day.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the failsafe, fallback gift, said ultramarathoner Peter Jones, co-owner of the Trident Cafe: \u201cCoffee, always coffee!\u201d Jones recently helped launch a new local roasting company, Idle Hands. \u201cRunners enjoy coffee, a good delicious cup of coffee. We get up early to get our workout in, and coffee is often what gets us up and wired.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And why the name Idle Hands? \u201cIn this day and age, it is especially important to take a moment and enjoy the cup of coffee you are about to drink,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIdle hands are OK; you can always jump back in and get busy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if you want to combine a running gift with something a bit stronger than coffee, check out Shoes &amp; Brews in Longmont, which has the best running store motto: \u201dRun Wild, Drink Beer.\u201d The store\u2019s Kerrianne Ruhling recommends \u201canything for visibility, like a reflective vest, or a head lamp. A lot of us are running in the early morning and evening, in the dark.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shoes &amp; Brews offers group runs every Thursday, with the option of hanging out afterward in the store\u2019s brewpub. Which makes its gift cards an especially nice present, Ruhling said. \u201cThe gift cards work on both sides\u201d of the store, either shoes or brews. There you go, all bases covered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Follow Michael Sandrock on Instagram: @MikeSandrock<\/em><\/p>\n",

The Colorado Supreme Court agreed.<\/p>\n<p>The case was sent back to trial, and this time, a jury found Rienzi Dickens not guilty.

Dickens, one of the wealthiest men in Boulder County, a pioneer (of the 1800s) and one of our most highly respected citizens, was foully murdered last night at eight o&#8217;clock, when an assassin fired a bullet thru the window of Dickens&#8217; home, wiping out the life of the victim without a second&#8217;s warning.<\/p>\n<p>The bullet entered the body a little to the right and under the right shoulder blade, passing out high in the right breast, and embedding itself in the far corner of the room.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Dickens, who was but a few feet from her husband, was cut in the face by flying glass, and the bullet passed within a few inches of her head. She showed remarkable self-control and presence of mind by rushing to the telephone and summoning a physician. But before the physician arrived, the victim of the assassin&#8217;s bullet was dead.<\/p>\n<p>W.C. Coulehan, who lives in the house adjoining the Dickens residence, rushed from his home the moment he heard the shot, and seeing at a glance what had happened, rushed out into the street, where he stopped all passersby in the hopes of learning the direction the murderer had taken when fleeing from his crime. He gained no knowledge, however, which would shed any light on the tragedy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crime Deliberate and Premeditated<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That the murder was cold-blooded and deliberate, almost beyond comprehension, is shown by the details of the case.<\/p>\n<p>The Dickens and Coulehan homes are aligned close together, with a distance of not more than fifteen or twenty feet between.

The couple were reading the evening papers in the quietude of their room, when Mr. Dickens met his untimely end. He was sitting beside a small center table, next to the window, his wife being just opposite.<\/p>\n<p>The murderer stood between the two houses, took deliberate aim and fired. The bullet entered the window at an angle, which showed that the slayer had stood back as far as possible, to be out of the lights from the two houses, but even then he would have been easily seen by anyone who happened to be passing.<\/p>\n<p>The deed was the most daring and premeditated in the criminal annals of Boulder County.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Acquainted With Customs of His Victim<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The slayer must have been acquainted with the customs of his victim. Mr. Dickens always retired before nine o&#8217;clock, and it was necessary, if he was to be killed from ambush, to commit the crime early in the evening. It must also have been known that Mr. Dickens spent his evenings in the little library, off from the noise of the street.<\/p>\n<p><strong>News Spreads Rapidly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The news of the assassination spread like wild fire. The news reached the Presbyterian Church, where the Choral club was giving a concert, and a large number of the men in the audience at once left their wives and hurried to the Dickens home.

            "rendered": "<p>A Longmont Latinx parent group is looking to involve more St. Vrain Valley families in their campaign to advocate for healthier school lunches.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elpasomovement.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ELPASO<\/a> (Engaged Latino Parents Advancing Student Outcomes) Voz Longmont, which includes about 18 parents, is a grassroots leadership group that started working on the school lunch issue more than a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>They researched the food served, looked at options in other districts that cook more of their food from scratch and talked to district leaders, from the food services director to the superintendent to school board members. The group now is sharing a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfobuaxvSyQ2utHxfx55Bn9mxvyEUp3G2iDiohNF0yCBY_VXA\/formResponse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">petition<\/a> on social media to increase involvement from parents outside the group, as well as reaching out to local farms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We would like to see something different, more fresh food, more food cooked in the schools,&#8221; said Caro Neri, ELPASO Voz Longmont&#8217;s community organizer. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been trying to understand more things and give them solutions. We really believe kids need to be fed with healthy food.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>St. Vrain Valley spokeswoman Kerri McDermid said all 1,595,000 meals the Nutrition Services team has served so far this school year have met or exceeded the U.S. Department of Agriculture standards. Local produce, including organic produce from Colorado&#8217;s Western Slope, also is incorporated whenever available, she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;St. Vrain has a strong focus on nutrition and has received many recognitions, such as the USDA&#8217;s Once in a Melon Award for administering an exemplary farm-to-school program,&#8221; she said in a written statement.<\/p>\n<p>But ELPASO members say they want more fresh-cooked options, with higher nutritional value. Neri said the group started by looking at the ingredients and nutritional information for two to three months&#8217; worth of school meals, finding many additives common to processed foods and too much sodium.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The more processed the food is, the more risk for the people who are eating it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Kids are developing obesity and high cholesterol.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>They visited the programs in both the Boulder Valley School District, which recently built a culinary center to prepare school meals, and Denver Public Schools, which cooks about half of what they serve from scratch, to get ideas.<\/p>\n<p>One challenge, Neri said, is district schools mainly have warming kitchens with ovens to heat up food, but not the equipment to prepare it from scratch. Another is the lack of a trained chef in the food services department.<\/p>\n<p>She said the district has made small changes since the group started advocating for healthier, such as switching condiments, but is still offering essentially the same meals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know it&#8217;s more than just the taste or, &#8216;My kids don&#8217;t like this,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some moms are working in the kitchens, some were volunteers before the pandemic, so they know what kind of food they are serving.

The group now is sharing a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfobuaxvSyQ2utHxfx55Bn9mxvyEUp3G2iDiohNF0yCBY_VXA\/formResponse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">petition<\/a> on social media to increase involvement from parents outside the group, as well as reaching out to local farms.<\/p>\n<p>\"We would like to see something different, more fresh food, more food cooked in the schools,\" said Caro Neri, ELPASO Voz Longmont's community organizer. \"We've been trying to understand more things and give them solutions. We really believe kids need to be fed with healthy food.\"<\/p>\n<p>St. Vrain Valley spokeswoman Kerri McDermid said all 1,595,000 meals the Nutrition Services team has served so far this school year have met or exceeded the U.S. Department of Agriculture standards. Local produce, including organic produce from Colorado's Western Slope, also is incorporated whenever available, she said.<\/p>\n<p>\"St. Vrain has a strong focus on nutrition and has received many recognitions, such as the USDA's Once in a Melon Award for administering an exemplary farm-to-school program,\" she said in a written statement.<\/p>\n<p>But ELPASO members say they want more fresh-cooked options, with higher nutritional value. Neri said the group started by looking at the ingredients and nutritional information for two to three months' worth of school meals, finding many additives common to processed foods and too much sodium.<\/p>\n<p>\"The more processed the food is, the more risk for the people who are eating it,\" she said. \"Kids are developing obesity and high cholesterol.\"<\/p>\n<p>They visited the programs in both the Boulder Valley School District, which recently built a culinary center to prepare school meals, and Denver Public Schools, which cooks about half of what they serve from scratch, to get ideas.<\/p>\n<p>One challenge, Neri said, is district schools mainly have warming kitchens with ovens to heat up food, but not the equipment to prepare it from scratch. Another is the lack of a trained chef in the food services department.<\/p>\n<p>She said the district has made small changes since the group started advocating for healthier, such as switching condiments, but is still offering essentially the same meals.<\/p>\n<p>\"We know it's more than just the taste or, 'My kids don't like this,'\" she said. \"Some moms are working in the kitchens, some were volunteers before the pandemic, so they know what kind of food they are serving. We want to convince them that change is necessary. They need to change the whole system.\"<\/p>\n<p>Susana Barrios, who has children at Indian Peaks Elementary and Sunset Middle schools, said she became interested in what's being served in school lunches years ago when her oldest would come home from school without eating lunch.<\/p>\n<p>He didn't like the food, she said, saying he didn't like the taste, the options or that food was served cold that should be hot. Her sons also both experienced health issues that could be related to diet, with her oldest's doctor recommending a change that prompted her to start packing his lunches.<\/p>\n<p>\"I immediately agreed to be part of (the ELPASO) project because, like me, there are countless families with these health problems based on school food,\" she said via email, adding she wants to see both healthier food and longer lunches.<\/p>\n<p>Karla Cardoza, who has children at Rocky Mountain Elementary and Trail Ridge Middle, said she considers the school lunch options \"unhealthy and highly processed.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Most of the time parents do not ask what the school food contains,\" she said via email. \"When we started our research with ELPASO Voz Longmont, I learned about the ingredients and the type of food that is given in schools.\"<\/p>\n<p>She said her children sometimes come home with headaches from not eating enough or with stomachaches.<\/p>\n<p>\"My wish is that they will switch to healthier and fresher food, food from scratch and prepared in a school kitchen,\" she said. \"And that they gave enough time for the children to learn to enjoy food.\"<\/p>\n",

But, at the time, Trevino was just curious how the eagles were holding up following the heavy, wet snow.<\/p>\n<p>The nest, on Boulder County Open Space property, just off Hygiene Road, has been there for more than 10 years. At the site, Trevino spotted a male eagle preening its feathers as it perched in a tree branch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m just going to pull off to the side of the road and wait to see if he takes off,'&#8221; Trevino said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to take pictures of birds in trees. It&#8217;s kind of boring to me. I prefer to take pictures of them in flight. It&#8217;s much more interesting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>About 30 minutes later, the eagle soared off to look for a snack in the nearby prairie dog field.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Lo and behold, he swept down on the snow to try and grab one of the prairie dogs that was sticking his head up out of the hole,&#8221; Trevino said. &#8220;He actually missed. I couldn&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1152485\"  class=\"wp-caption alignright size-article_inline\"><img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"251px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 780w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 810w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 1280w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 1860w\" width=\"1923\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 620w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 780w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 810w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 1280w,https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dailycamera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DCC-Z-NINJA-01.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 1860w\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art Trevino, of Longmont, shared the photo he captured of a ninja prairie dog defending itself against an eagle. Trevino captured this shot March 15 just outside of Hygiene. (Courtesy Art Trevino)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>After his failed attempt, the raptor landed a few feet from the prairie dog. Perhaps seizing on the bird&#8217;s lack of grace, the prairie dog jumped in the air and lunged at the eagle, causing the bird to stumble backward, kicking up snow in its wake.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Like a real David and Goliath story, the prairie dog actually goes after the eagle, and the eagle is startled,&#8221; Trevino said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a one-in-a-million shot.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After demonstrating its ninja abilities, Trevino said, the prairie dog then scrambled back to safety to its hole in the ground.<\/p>\n<p>While he happened to stumble on a particularly brazen prairie dog, Trevino isn&#8217;t a novice photographer who just got a lucky shot.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino studied photography while he was going to school at the University of Texas in Austin during the &#8217;70s and has been a wildlife photographer for over 40 years. Though today he said his day job with a TV antenna service pays the bills, he runs a side business taking photos of wildlife, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pappadukes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pappa Dukes Productions<\/a> \u2014 a nod to Trevino&#8217;s nickname Pappa Dukes, which he earned while playing in a band with his son.<\/p>\n<p>Using his Sony A9 camera, he&#8217;s captured raptors in flight, moose grazing on tender grass in a meadow, mountains mirrored in pristine ponds and lonely prairies under starry skies. He also shares his expertise by serving as a tour guide in Estes Park, where he teaches people how to take better wildlife photos in Rocky Mountain National Park.<\/p>\n<p>A few days after he got the prairie dog and eagle shot, Trevino shared the photo on Facebook. People started encouraging him to enter the photo, dubbed &#8220;Ninja Prairie Dog!&#8221; into The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards. Trevino decided to give it a shot.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino said his photo was one of more than 7,000 contest entries from all over the world. While the photo didn&#8217;t claim the overall winner, it was recognized with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comedywildlifephoto.com\/gallery\/comedy-widlife-2021-competition-winners.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Walker&#8217;s Serian Creatures on the Land Award<\/a>. Trevino found out he earned the category win on Nov. 16. He received a certificate, camera bag and notoriety for his efforts, including interviews on TV and numerous media publications.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not too disappointed because it&#8217;s a pretty big deal to be chosen second out of over 7,000 entries \u2014 international entries, not just U.S. entries,&#8221; Trevino said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been quite humbling.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Michelle Wood, an organizer for the comedy wildlife organization, wrote in an email that Trevino&#8217;s shot is the perfect example of being in the right place at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The narrative is priceless, &#8221; Wood wrote in an email. &#8220;This is hard to capture at the best of times, but it is also a beautifully shot image. Art has managed to create a brilliant composition with wonderful colors and tones.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards were started by founders Paul Joynson-Hicks, a Tanzanian-based photographer, and Tom Sullam. They wanted to run a photo contest that would feature funny wildlife situations as a way to create empathy and understanding for animals, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comedywildlifephoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As a way to give back, The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards donates 10% of its total net revenue to conservation projects that work to protect endangered wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope that by grabbing people\u2019s attention with these amazing and funny images, we can encourage a much wider and louder conversation about wildlife conservation and how we need to start looking after the planet and the fragile habitats that are being destroyed on a daily basis,&#8221; Wood wrote.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino hopes his story taps into this message. Even though in Boulder County prairie dogs are often viewed as pests, Trevino said, they play an important role in the ecosystem by serving as a source of food for raptors, foxes and bobcats.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By hopefully showing this photograph and bringing more of a human nature to these prairie dogs and eagles, it will really stress the importance of preserving these prairie dog colonies, especially for raptors and any predator out there,&#8221; Trevino said.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino added he is conscientious about not disturbing wildlife when photographing them and uses a long lens so that he can maintain distance from their habitats.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino said that he feels fortunate to be living in Boulder County, where so much natural beauty and wildlife can be found. He encouraged people to get outdoors and see it for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Enjoy our beautiful national park that we have just a few miles from us; all the trails we have up in the mountains; all the places around Boulder, Longmont and the Front Range \u2014 it&#8217;s just so gorgeous,&#8221; Trevino said.<\/p>\n",

            "print_content": "<p>A day after a blizzard whipped through Boulder County, dropping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timescall.com\/2021\/03\/14\/blizzard-drops-2-feet-of-snow-on-longmont\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 2 feet of snow<\/a> on Longmont on March 14, Art Trevino drove the freshly plowed roads in search of an eagle's nest west of Hygiene.<\/p>\n<p>It was on this venture that Trevino, 71, of Longmont, would capture a photo that would win an award from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comedywildlifephoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Comedy Wildlife Photography Competition<\/a>, an international contest seeking to promote conservation. But, at the time, Trevino was just curious how the eagles were holding up following the heavy, wet snow.<\/p>\n<p>The nest, on Boulder County Open Space property, just off Hygiene Road, has been there for more than 10 years. At the site, Trevino spotted a male eagle preening its feathers as it perched in a tree branch.<\/p>\n<p>\"I said, 'I'm just going to pull off to the side of the road and wait to see if he takes off,'\" Trevino said. \"I don't care to take pictures of birds in trees. It's kind of boring to me. I prefer to take pictures of them in flight. It's much more interesting.\"<\/p>\n<p>About 30 minutes later, the eagle soared off to look for a snack in the nearby prairie dog field.<\/p>\n<p>\"Low and behold, he swept down on the snow to try and grab one of the prairie dogs that was sticking his head up out of the hole,\" Trevino said. \"He actually missed. I couldn't believe it.\"<\/p>\n<p>After his failed attempt, the raptor landed a few feet from the prairie dog. Perhaps seizing on the bird's lack of grace, the prairie dog jumped in the air and lunged at the eagle, causing the bird to stumble backward, kicking up snow in its wake.<\/p>\n<p>\"Like a real David and Goliath story, the prairie dog actually goes after the eagle, and the eagle is startled,\" Trevino said. \"It's a one-in-a-million shot.\"<\/p>\n<p>After demonstrating its ninja abilities, Trevino said, the prairie dog then scrambled back to safety to its hole in the ground.<\/p>\n<p>While he happened to stumble on a particularly brazen prairie dog, Trevino isn't a novice photographer who just got a lucky shot.<\/p>\n<p>Trevino studied photography while he was going to school at the University of Texas in Austin during the '70s and has been a wildlife photographer for over 40 years.
