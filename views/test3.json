Espinoza is also facing an additional count of violation of a protection order that Droessler had against him.</p>\n<p>According to an affidavit, Longmont police were called to a Super 8 Motel at 2446 Main St. on Friday for a report of an armed robbery.</p>\n<p>The night clerk said he let two people in who then proceeded to point a gun at his head and to demand he give them the cash drawer, which had about $300 in it.</p>\n<p>Police reviewed surveillance footage and noted the disguises the two suspects were wearing — including masks, caps and wigs — matched similar robberies at that Super 8 Motel and a Holiday Inn in late 2021.</p>\n<p>Other employees of the motel also reviewed the security footage and were able to identify one of the suspects as Espinoza, who had been an employee at the Super 8. In the surveillance footage, it is Espinoza who appears to put the gun to the head of the clerk, according to the affidavit.</p>\n<p>Police went to Espinoza&#8217;s address and placed him into custody, along with Droessler.</p>\n<p>Droessler confessed to helping Espinoza with the robberies, and told police what they were wearing at the time.</p>\n<p>A search of the apartment also turned up wigs and caps that matched those seen in the surveillance footage. A BB gun matching the weapon used in the robberies was also found on scene.</p>\n<p>Both Espinoza and Droessler were then arrested, and Espinoza is set for a hearing on July 1 while Droessler will appear on June 27.</p>\n<p>Espinoza also has a pending felony menacing case in Boulder County, and has a prior conviction for felony menacing and harassment for which he was on probation.</p>\n<p>Espinoza is being held on $100,000 bond, while Droessler was released on a $500 cash bond.</p>\n",
